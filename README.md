Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
Project Overview
This project builds a stock price prediction system using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model forecasts future stock prices based on historical data, enabling investors and analysts to make informed decisions.

Features
Uses historical stock price data for training

LSTM model captures temporal dependencies in time series data

Data preprocessing including scaling and sequence generation

Real-time stock ticker input to fetch data from Yahoo Finance

Visualization of actual vs predicted stock prices

Flask web app interface for easy interaction

Dataset
The system uses historical stock price data downloaded dynamically via the yfinance API. The data includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume, starting from 2015 up to the latest available date.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-lstm.git
cd stock-price-prediction-lstm
Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Step 1: Run the Flask app
Start the Flask web application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Step 2: Access the app
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000, enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT), and get the predicted stock prices plotted alongside actual prices.

Model Details
LSTM Network: A Recurrent Neural Network variant suited for sequential time series data.

Data Preprocessing: Includes scaling features with MinMaxScaler and creating sequences for model input.

Prediction: The model outputs future stock prices based on past sequences.

Future Improvements
Add hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy

Integrate additional features like technical indicators (RSI, MACD)

Deploy on cloud platforms such as Heroku or AWS for public access

Include multiple stock comparisons and batch predictions

Use more advanced models like GRU, Transformer-based time series models
